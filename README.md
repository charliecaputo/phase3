# phase 3
This is the final part to a semester long project in which (in short) we learned how to contorl a ur5e robot utilizing ros, opencv, and a couple of other tools.
Important Note for future me: if you want to show this off in the simulated environment use the commit named "saving, docker bugging". You integrated Dr. Saeidis grasper code in the "Final" and the code won't run in the simulated environment.
